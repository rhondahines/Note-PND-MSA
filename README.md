# Note-PND-MSA
It is our understanding when someone is approved for GA and applying for SSA benefits we are supposed to ‘PEND MSA’ by entering a case note.  So, if/when SSA benefits approved, if other elig criteria is met, MSA can be issued back to that date.  Could someone create a script to make this easier for EW's?
